I no longer feel motivated to work on this project. Adding features like block breaking and placing just seems like too big of a task for me ðŸ˜…. I decided to leave this repo public in the case someone would find by spaghetti code useful xd.

# ABOUT
This repository is for a Minecraft pathfinding bot. It builds upon and improves [this](https://github.com/KaptainWutax/tungsten) GitHub repository by KaptainWutax.

# CAN I TRY IT?
Yes, but keep in mind it's still in early development, so you should expect some quirks and bugs. 

To download the mod go to the [releases](https://github.com/MiranCZ/Tungsten/releases/) and download the latest version. You will also need [Baritone API](https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone/releases/tag/v1.9.4) and [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api/version/0.76.0+1.19.2).

# COMMANDS
`/@start` - finds path and walks to the target

`/@stop` - stops walking/pathing to target

`/@target <pos>` - sets the positions as the target (note: for convenience of inputting auto completed position when looking at the block is `Y` of target position always 1 higher)

`/@record` - draws line behind you (note: to stop recording just type `/@record` again)
